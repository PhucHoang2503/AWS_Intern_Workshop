### Week 5 Achievements:

- Completed Lab 10 with the following outcomes:

  - Received an overview of the AWS CloudFormation service.
  - Gained hands-on practice by building a template, updating a Security Group (SG), and accessing an EC2 instance through a Remote Desktop Gateway Server (RDGW).
  - Worked on setting up a Directory Service.

- Explored Route 53 functionality:

  - Configured a Route 53 Outbound Endpoint.
  - Created DNS Resolver Rules.
  - Set up an Inbound Endpoint for Route 53.
  - Verified that all connections were working correctly afterward.
  - Successfully established communication between an on-premises environment and the AWS cloud using Directory Service and a Remote Desktop Gateway Server.

- Completed Lab 19 with the following achievements:
  - Understood the concept of VPC isolation and the purpose of establishing VPC Peering for secure, private communication between VPCs.
  - Successfully configured a VPC Peering connection between two VPCs to enable direct traffic routing via private IP.
  - Practiced working with Network ACLs as subnet-level stateless firewalls and updated ACL rules to allow required traffic.
  - Implemented routing updates in Route Tables to enable bidirectional communication between the two VPCs.
  - Configured Cross-Peer DNS to allow resources in each VPC to resolve DNS names across the peering connection.
  - Completed the full workflow: preparation → updating Network ACLs → creating the Peering connection → configuring route tables → enabling Cross-Peer DNS.
