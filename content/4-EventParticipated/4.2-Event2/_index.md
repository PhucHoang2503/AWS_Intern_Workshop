# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 : DevOps on AWS Workshop”

### Event Objectives

- The workshop aimed to help participants understand DevOps as a culture and philosophy—not just a toolkit—grounded in collaboration, speed, and continuous improvement, reinforced by key indicators such as DORA metrics.
- Attendees received a comprehensive walkthrough of the AWS DevOps toolchain, covering every stage of the software lifecycle from code management to production operations.
- Rather than focusing solely on theory, the event featured practical demos showing how to build CI/CD pipelines, deploy infrastructure as code, and run containerized applications.
- The sessions highlighted how to monitor, trace, and troubleshoot systems effectively in distributed, cloud-native environments.

### Key Highlights

#### From Code to Cloud: Automating the CI/CD Pipeline

- **Content**: Focused on building a complete CI/CD workflow using AWS DevOps services:
  - **CodeCommit** for version control and recommended branching strategies.
  - **CodeBuild** to automate build and testing stages.
  - **CodeDeploy** with modern deployment techniques such as Blue/Green, Rolling, and Canary.
  - **CodePipeline** to orchestrate the entire process into a unified automation flow.
- **Key Moment**: The live demonstration of a full pipeline—from code commit to production deployment—helped illustrate how each step connects to form a seamless delivery process.

#### Laying the Foundation: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Content**: Shifted toward cloud resource management using code-driven approaches:
  - **AWS CloudFormation** and its declarative templates.
  - **AWS CDK**, enabling infrastructure creation through familiar programming languages.
- **Key Moment**: Seeing CloudFormation and CDK demonstrated side-by-side made it easier to understand their practical differences and helped participants determine when to use each tool.

#### Deploying Modern Applications: The Container Ecosystem

- **Content**: Explored the role of containers in modern application architectures:
  - Managing images with **Amazon ECR**.
  - Comparing **Amazon ECS** (fully managed operations) and **Amazon EKS** (maximum flexibility).
  - Introducing **AWS App Runner** for simplified deployments without managing infrastructure.
- **Key Moment**: The session’s microservices case study provided a clear look at the trade-offs among App Runner, ECS, and EKS in real-world scenarios.

#### Closing the Loop: Full-Stack Observability

- **Content**: The final session focused on monitoring and tracing applications in production:
  - **Amazon CloudWatch** for metrics and logs.
  - **AWS X-Ray** for end-to-end distributed tracing.
  - Best practices for alerts, dashboards, and on-call procedures.
- **Key Moment**: The live tracing demo—following a single request across multiple microservices—highlighted how observability uncovers bottlenecks that traditional monitoring often misses.

### Key Takeaways

#### Automation & Pipelines

- **Building a Complete CI/CD Workflow**: Learned how to design and operate a fully automated delivery pipeline that accelerates deployments while reducing manual errors.
- **Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals**: Gained an understanding of how to manage cloud environments through version-controlled templates and code, along with clear guidance on when to choose CloudFormation or the AWS CDK.

#### Modern Application Deployment

- **Containerization on AWS**: Received a practical framework for selecting the right container service—ECS, EKS, or App Runner—based on team expertise, architectural needs, and operational complexity.
- **Advanced Deployment Techniques**: Explored safe-release strategies like feature flags, A/B testing, and progressive rollouts to minimize risks during updates.

#### System Reliability & Operations

- **Building Observable Systems**: Learned how metrics, logs, and traces work together to reveal system behavior and accelerate troubleshooting in distributed environments.
- **Applying DevOps Best Practices**: Gained insight into effective incident response, postmortems, and developing a culture centered on learning and improvement.

### Event Experience

The “DevOps on AWS” workshop delivered a full-day immersion into the realities of building, shipping, and operating modern applications.

> Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also helped me reshape my thinking about application design, system modernization, and cross-team collaboration.
