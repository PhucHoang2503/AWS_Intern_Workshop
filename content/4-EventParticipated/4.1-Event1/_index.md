  - **Prompt Engineering**: Methods to design high-quality prompts, including strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and guided examples.
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: How to link GenAI models to enterprise knowledge sources for contextual, accurate outputs.
  - **Bedrock Agents & Safety Controls**: Building multi-step autonomous workflows and applying Guardrails for responsible AI usage.
- **Key Moment**: The live demo of constructing a GenAI chatbot using Bedrock served as the capstone experience, showing how quickly a prototype can be built.

### Key Takeaways

#### Traditional Machine Learning

- **Holistic Workflow Understanding**: You gained clarity on how to manage an ML project end-to-end using Amazon SageMaker, from raw dataset ingestion to production deployment.
- **Operational Excellence with MLOps**: You saw how automation and governance tools within SageMaker help streamline model development, improve reproducibility, and support large-scale operations.

#### Generative AI

- **Model Selection & Prompt Crafting**: You learned practical considerations for choosing foundation models and applying effective prompting techniques.
- **Integrating Internal Knowledge**: You now understand how RAG architectures enable AI to leverage proprietary data, resulting in more relevant and precise outputs.
- **Building Safe, Automated AI Solutions**: You gained insight into Bedrock Agents for multi-step workflows and Guardrails for ensuring AI systems operate within organizational safety guidelines.

### Event Experience

Spending the morning at the AWS Vietnam office offered a refreshing blend of learning, inspiration, and technical exploration.

#### Establishing the Fundamentals

The SageMaker segment provided a strong structural foundation. Instead of abstract theory, you were guided through an organized and repeatable ML development flow. The SageMaker Studio walkthrough was especially impactful, turning complex workflows into something tangible and intuitive.

#### Exploring the Future with GenAI

The Bedrock session introduced a sense of excitement and forward momentum. Although topics like RAG and autonomous agents are often challenging, the presenters explained them in a relatable and practical way. The live chatbot demo delivered the defining moment of the event—witnessing an AI application come to life in real time underscored how accessible and empowering Generative AI has become.

> Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also helped me reshape my thinking about application design, system modernization, and cross-team collaboration.
