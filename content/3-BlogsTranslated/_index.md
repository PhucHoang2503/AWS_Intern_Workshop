### [Blog 1 - Enhance governance with metadata enforcement rules in Amazon SageMaker](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog shows how metadata enforcement rules in Amazon SageMaker improve data governance by standardizing required information across publishing and access workflows. Much like building a structured data lake with modern architectural practices, these rules bring consistency, compliance, and clearer ownership to the data lifecycle. By enforcing key metadata and supporting custom approval flows, organizations can maintain higher data quality and streamline access, creating a more reliable and scalable foundation for analytics and AI.

### [Blog 2 - Enhance resiliency and data protection for SAP HANA high-availability deployments with Amazon Backup for SAP HANA](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog introduces how to build a resilient backup architecture for SAP HANA High-Availability deployments on AWS using AWS Backup. You will learn why backups are still essential beyond HA—for protection against corruption, errors, ransomware, and compliance needs—and how AWS Backup provides automated, consistent, and scalable data protection. The article also walks through setting up the environment, running backup/restore operations in a Pacemaker cluster, and applying best practices for performance, monitoring, disaster recovery, and governance to ensure secure and reliable SAP HANA operations on AWS.

### [Blog 3 - Extend the Amazon Q Developer CLI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Richer Context](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog introduces how MCP (Model Context Protocol) support in Amazon Q Developer CLI enhances developer productivity by enabling richer, context-aware workflows. With MCP tools and prompts, Q Developer can connect to external data sources—such as PostgreSQL—without custom integration code, allowing it to understand schemas, write accurate queries, generate tests, and document databases. By standardizing how Q Developer accesses and shares context, MCP expands its capabilities and streamlines development tasks, creating a faster, more integrated developer experience.
